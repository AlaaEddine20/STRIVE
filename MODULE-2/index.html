          <p class="description">
            Meteora is the second studio album by American rock band Linkin
            Park. It was released on March 25, 2003 through Warner Bros.
            Records, following Reanimation, a collaboration album which featured
            remixes of songs included on their 2000 debut studio album Hybrid
            Theory. The album was produced by the band alongside Don Gilmore.
            The title Meteora is taken from the Greek Orthodox monasteries
            originally bearing the name. Meteora has a similar sound to
            Hybrid Theory, as described by critics, and the album took almost a
            year to be recorded. It is the first Linkin Park studio album to
            feature bassist Dave Farrell after he rejoined the band in 2000.
            Meteora debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over
            810,000 copies in its first week. Linkin Park released singles
            from Meteora for over a year, including "Somewhere I Belong",
            "Faint", "Numb", "From the Inside", and "Breaking the Habit".
            Meteora received generally positive reviews, although critics noted
            that the album's musical style was similar to its predecessor,
            Hybrid Theory. Meteora has sold around 16 million copies worldwide,
            making it one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. It is
            certified 7x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of
            America (RIAA). It was ranked number 36 on the Billboard Top 200
            Albums of the 2000s.[3] Some songs from the album were remixed with
            some of Jay-Z's songs for the EP Collision Course (2004). "Session"
            was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 46th
            Grammy Awards.
